Read 'README.md' for a description of the SDL2 Tetris game.

All the sources of this project (excepted for the SDL2 for which I am not the author and not supplied
in this project, has been written in C), have been written with the C++ language and needs at least a
compiler that provide the 2017 C++ standard functionalities (like fileSystem header).

The Sdl2 warren Tetris project has three dependencies:
- The SimpleDirectMediaLayer v2.x library (also called 'SDL2')
- The CMake build tool.
- The WarrenGamesCustomLibs, that you can download on my repository (infos on how to use them are indicated
	in the 'compileSourcesHowTo.txt' of theses libraries). You will have to set in the main CMakeLists.txt of
	the SDL2-Warren-Tetris project the path of the built WarrenGamesCustomLibs libraries for the following variable:
	'WARREN_LIBS_BUILDING_PATH' (line 18)

Implemented executables purposes:
'game' : the tetris game.

How to download the dependencies (if you don't have repositories to get them directly, for example):
The SDL2 can be downloaded from this web site: 'https://www.libsdl.org'
The CMake project configuration tool can be downloaded fromÂ this web site: 'https://www.cmake.org'

-----------------
Run compilation configuration with CMake under Ubuntu in a terminal:
Open a terminal in the top project directory and run cmake with this command:

cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSQUARE_SIZE=64 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-11 -S. -B../build

This will create Makefiles (because of the option -G"Unix Makefiles" ) a Release compilation type (not a Debug 
one) a square size of 64 pixels ( -DSQUARE_SIZE=64 ) with the 'g++-11' compiler the compiled files will be in 
'../build' directory. In Ubuntu you don't have to tell in the main CMakeLists.txt file the location of the 
extern dependencies like SDL2 (with 'SDL2_DIR' value).

-----------------
Run compilation configuration with CMake under Windows with Visual Studio:
You must set the following string values in the main CMakeLists.txt so the project will use SDL2 and wxWidgets
libraries:
- SDL2_DIR "'path of the SDL2 library'" (for example: "E:/prog/library/SDL2-2.0.20/i686-w64-mingw32" for a 
	32 bits compilation (note the 'i686-w64-mingw32' last dir for that purpose or: 
	"E:/prog/library/SDL2-2.0.20/x86_64-w64-ming32" for a 64 bits compilation with 'x86_64-w64-mingw32' sub 
	directory this time.
